Fix moderator page (show stats first then allow user to select what they want to do)
Show these: needs approval, reported, updated
Fix bug in add venue page



These are done:

1. Create restaurant profile page (would it be nicer to have ability to add reviews tips and reports at the same page?)
2. Collect users IP on reviews
3. Add staff field to user model (who should make user as staff, another stuff or site admin?)
4. Rename tip field to note
5. add restaurant slug

two types of users: regular and moderator (i will set this from admin panel)
moderators will have special page where they can approve new restaurants submitted by regular user. Moderators will also have a page where they can see which restaurants has been recently updated or reviewed.

any user can submit restaurants. New restaurants will need to be approved by moderators. Once approved they will be available on the restaurant search page and the json api.

Moderator can suspend any restaurant. In that case restaurant will remain in db, but won’t be shown on search page.
