Add update, report and review page for mobile sites (high priority)



After new restaurant is submitted, show message "Submitted for review" - this will be a new page.



On every restaurant, add button for moderators, they can remove restaurant and write a note for removing.

On moderator page, create two rows, one for restaurants one for masjids

Restaurant approval page: separate columns for: "Needs Approval", "Suspended"



Add masjid page, add this on moderator page

put filters: Today, this week, this month on moderator page.

Done:

Show confirmation  after review is submitted.
Allow multiple selection for cuisine.

Fix moderator page (show stats first then allow user to select what they want to do)
Show these: needs approval, reported, updated
Fix bug in add venue page



These are done:

1. Create restaurant profile page (would it be nicer to have ability to add reviews tips and reports at the same page?)
2. Collect users IP on reviews
3. Add staff field to user model (who should make user as staff, another stuff or site admin?)
4. Rename tip field to note
5. add restaurant slug

two types of users: regular and moderator (i will set this from admin panel)
moderators will have special page where they can approve new restaurants submitted by regular user. Moderators will also have a page where they can see which restaurants has been recently updated or reviewed.

any user can submit restaurants. New restaurants will need to be approved by moderators. Once approved they will be available on the restaurant search page and the json api.

Moderator can suspend any restaurant. In that case restaurant will remain in db, but wonâ€™t be shown on search page.
