4. Rename tip field to note
5. add restaurant slug

two types of users: regular and moderator (i will set this from admin panel)
moderators will have special page where they can approve new restaurants submitted by regular user. Moderators will also have a page where they can see which restaurants has been recently updated or reviewed.

any user can submit restaurants. New restaurants will need to be approved by moderators. Once approved they will be available on the restaurant search page and the json api.

Moderator can suspend any restaurant. In that case restaurant will remain in db, but won’t be shown on search page.
